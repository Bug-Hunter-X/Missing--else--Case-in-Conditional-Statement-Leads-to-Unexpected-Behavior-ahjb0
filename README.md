# Missing 'else' Case Bug in Python

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Python that arises from an incomplete conditional statement.  The `function_with_uncommon_bug` function handles values greater than 5 and equal to 5, but neglects values less than 5. This can lead to unexpected results or silent failures if not handled carefully.

The `bug.py` file showcases the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version.

## Bug

The missing `else` block in the conditional statement of the `function_with_uncommon_bug` function leads to values less than 5 being ignored.
